"""Automatically reloading modules when their source has been updated.

This also allows for some state retention in reloaded modules, for modules
to specify dependencies that must be checked for being outdated as well, and to
unload those dependencies on reload.

There are two ways that we use to track if something should be reloaded, the
last modification time of a file, and the last time we reloaded a module.

The modification time is to determine if a module has actually changed, and if
it is newer than a previously seen time, then that module will be reloaded.

Every module reload will store the time at which it reloads (determined at the
start of an autoreload cycle). Then, in another autoreload cycle, another
module can see when it's dependencies changes by comparing its reload time with
the dependency's. If a dependency was reloaded, then reload ourselves as well.

This is not perfect, and it is known to cause numerous issues (e.g. circular
imports cause some strange problems), however we have found that the problems
it brings up are minor in comparison to the speed boost it tends to give us
while in active development.

A better algorithm would construct a full module graph (doing something about
cycles), and iteratively expand the region that must be reloaded. It may cull
those who have not changes, linearize the remaining dependencies and reload
everything in a big chain.

The tricky part is since `module discovery <discovery>` does not reveal the
actual intensions of the code, e.g.:

.. digraph:: actual_graph

    {rank=same; "core" "gui" "utils"}

    "__init__" -> "core"

    "core" -> "utils"

    "gui" -> "core"
    "gui" -> "utils"

but all the dependancies that it is actually capable of, e.g.:

.. digraph:: discovered_graph

    {rank=same; "core" "gui" "utils"}

    "__init__" -> "core"

    "core" -> "__init__" [constraint=false]
    "core" -> "utils"

    "gui" -> "__init__" [constraint=false]
    "gui" -> "core"
    "gui" -> "utils"
